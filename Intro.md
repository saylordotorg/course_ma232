This course is a continuation of Abstract Algebra I: we will revisit
structures like groups, rings, and fields as well as mappings like
homomorphisms and isomorphisms.  We will also take a look at ring
factorization, which will lead us to a discussion of the solutions of
polynomials over abstracted structures instead of numbers sets.  We will
end the section on rings with a discussion of general lattices, which
have both set and logical properties, and a special type of lattice
known as Boolean algebra, which plays an important role in probability. 
We will also visit an important topic in mathematics that you have
likely encountered already: vector spaces.  Vector spaces are central to
the study of linear algebra, but because they are extended groups, group
theory and geometric methods can be used to study them. Later in this
course, we will take a look at more advanced topics and consider several
useful theorems and counting methods.  We will end the course by
studying Galois theory—one of the most important theories in algebra,
but one that requires a thorough understanding of much of the content we
will study beforehand.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  
    

-   Compute the sizes of finite groups when certain properties are known
    about those groups.
-   Identify and manipulate solvable and nilpotent groups. 
-   Determine whether a polynomial ring is divisible or not and divide
    the polynomial (if it is divisible).
-   Determine the basis of a vector space, change bases, and manipulate
    linear transformations.
-   Define and use the Fundamental Theorem of Invertible Matrices. 
-   Use Galois theory to find general solutions of a polynomial over a
    field.
