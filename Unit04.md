**Unit 4: Galois Theory** <span id="4"></span> 
*Unit 4 concerns one of the most important theories in abstract algebra:
Galois theory.  Evariste Galois is one of the most enigmatic figures in
mathematics.  Incredibly intelligent, he intimidated many of the finest
mathematical minds in France as a teenager.  A proponent of democracy at
the height of monarchy in France, the hotheaded Galois was tricked into
accepting a duel against a veteran swordsman, Pescheux d’Herbinville, at
age 20.  Realizing that he probably would not survive the duel, Galois
spent much of his last night alive frantically compiling ideas he had on
general solutions of polynomials.  The notes he wrote to his friend
Auguste Chevalier became the foundation for what we now know as Galois
theory.*  
 *             
 First, Galois used permutation groups to show how roots of a polynomial
are related.  After learning about permutation groups, we will look at
Galois groups, which are sets of automorphisms on an extension field L
of some field K.  We will then conclude the unit (and the course) with a
long look at the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, which states that
subgroups of the Galois group for extension field L for some field K
correspond with the subfields of K that contain L.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 14 hours to complete.   
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.3: 5 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Use permutation groups to find solutions to polynomials.
-   Determine the Galois group of a polynomial.
-   Determine if a polynomial is solvable by radicals by determining if
    the Galois group of the polynomial is a solvable group.
